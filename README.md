Project involves creating a C++ program that reads average yearly temperatures for various cities from a file, converts these temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and writes the converted values to a new file. 
The main objectives of the project include:

Reading Data from a File:
        
        The program reads data from an input file named FahrenheitTemperature.txt.
        This file contains the names of six cities and their respective average yearly temperatures in Fahrenheit, each on a new line.

 Converting Temperatures:

    The program converts each temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula:
    Celsius=(Fahrenheitâˆ’32) x 5/9
 
 Writing Data to a New File:

    The program writes the names of the cities and their converted temperatures to an output file named CelsiusTemperature.txt.
    The output file contains the city names and their temperatures in Celsius, formatted to two decimal places.
